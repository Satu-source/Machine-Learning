# Step 6 – Demonstrating and testing

When I finally get my app work, I try it inside **Android studio** first. That first try wasn’t quite successful because the app opened but when I pressed button to take picture app crashed like we can see in video below( *video 1*)

After this try I know that at least my app opens and it’s working somehow so next I try fix my codes that app is not crashing when I try press button to take picture. 

Next version was working better, I made some changes in my codes inside files that I explain in **step 5**. Now my app open and it’s not crashing anymore when I press *“take image”* button, app ask permission to use camera and then its opening camera and taking picture. So finally, I have an app that is working and not crashing, after all fighting with the codes and Android studio this was small winner for me.
