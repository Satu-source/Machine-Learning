# Machine-Learning
Here is my Machine Learning project in spring 2025

Goal in this project is to build and end-to-end AI/ML deployment on mobile device, in this assignment I use CSC puhti supercomputer to run my code and train my model. After I am done with this project, I have knowledge of how to use Neural Networks in machine learning and also how to apply those in android applications.

**Steps for this project**
1.	Define & Pla
2.	Collect & Prepare Data
3.	Train & Evaluate on CSC Puhti Supercomputer
4.	Optimize for Mobile Device
5.	Build the Android App
6.	Test & Demo


Project deadline is 16 of May 2025

**Branches I have in my GitHub are:**
**- Satu-source-Data**
This branch have all image data I use in my assignment project, there is three different     folder that have all images. There is also CSV file for later use that contains nutrition information from different foods.
**- Satu-source-Android_app_codes**
This branch have all the code I use to do my Android application; files are named after file where code belong in Android Studio so then its easy to build new app later and make files    that needs to do.
**- Codes**
This branch have all the codes I use, there is image preprocessing codes and also different versions what I try. You can also find testing code and mobile optimization code here. Code names are same that I have used in documentary so itâ€™s easier to find which code is used     which part of project when you read documentary.
**- Satu-source-documentary**
This branch have all documentary from step 1 to step 6, documentary tells what I have done and why I have done certain things in that step and also there is code name that I have used in that step.
