# Machine-Learning
Here is my Machine Learning project in spring 2025

Goal in this project is to build and end-to-end AI/ML deployment on mobile device, in this assignment I use CSC puhti supercomputer to run my code and train my model. After I am done with this project, I have knowledge of how to use Neural Networks in machine learning and also how to apply those in android applications.

**Steps for this project**
1.	Define & Pla
2.	Collect & Prepare Data
3.	Train & Evaluate on CSC Puhti Supercomputer
4.	Optimize for Mobile Device
5.	Build the Android App
6.	Test & Demo


Project deadline is in 16 of May 2025
